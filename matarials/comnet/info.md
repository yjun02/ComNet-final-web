Course Objectives
▪Understand the layered architecture of computer network 
▪Understand the TCP/IP protocol and implement the server and client 
program by socket programming  
▪Understand the protocols widely used in the computer networks, 
including HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ARP, and etc. 
▪Analyze the protocol in action and network performance by using 
Wireshark tool

Course Description
▪In this course, we will study about the layered architecture and 
protocols of computer networks. By top-down approach, from 
application layer to link layer, we will learn about protocols widely 
used in current Internet. In particular, we will focus on understanding 
of TCP/IP protocol and implementing the server/client program 
through socket programming. In addition, we will try to design a 
protocol. We will cover topics as follows: layered architecture of 
current Internet, application layer (HTTP, E-mail, DNS), transport 
layer (TCP, UDP, socket programming), network layer (IP, ICMP, 
Routing), and link layer (ARP).

▪Attendance
• 0.5 point penalty is given for absence. (3 tardiness == 1 absence)
• If you are absent more than 1/4, you will get F grade. 
▪Assignments
• We are going to have some assignments and class activities including practice. 
• All assignments must be handed in before the due date. 
• If the assignment is late than due date, -1 pts penalty per day is given. 
• 1 day late: -1pts,  2 days late: -2pts,  3 days late: -3pts
• Late submissions are allowed up to 3 days.

Course Operation Plan (4/6)
▪Honor code 
• We must adhere to the Handong Honor Code.
• Any form of cheating will result in a score of zero.
• For programming assignments and tests, the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT 
and Copilot is strictly prohibited.
• Copying code from colleagues is not allowed.
If you are caught cheating on any assignment, you will receive a score of 0 for 
all of your assignments, regardless of the points you've earned on other 
assignments.
Both the person who provides the code and the one who copies it will receive a 
score of zero.
