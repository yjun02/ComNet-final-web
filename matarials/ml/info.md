Administrivia
• Class participation (7%)
• Each class meeting consists of 
• Brief review on the provided lecture materials
• Discussion
• During the meetings, students are encouraged to ask and answer questions
• Discussion is basically for questions and answers; students are encouraged not 
only to ask questions but also to answer others’ questions
• Every input you make counts towards your participation score
• Asking / answering a question in English (maximum 1 pt. / class)
• Questions given in Korean do not count
